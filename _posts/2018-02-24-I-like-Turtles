    <td>In our lesson today we moved on from quiz making onto a new type of coding. The language is called 'python with turtle' and allows you to give commands to a turtle that can draw shapes and lines on the screen. Our lesson consisted of mostly experimenting with this new type of coding and trying to get to grips on how it worked. We were set a difficult task later on which was to have the turtle draw every shape (up to 20 sides) on the screen. This kept us all occupied for the rest of the lesson</td>

    <td>As it was a new project, I found it very helpful to work with the people around me. None of us had ever used this kind of coding before and it was exciting for us testing it out. We all found it helpful to share ideas when we found new features of the code and it allowed us all to make good progress and come close to finishing the difficult task that we were set. I also found it helpful to refer back to my old work and look at code we have used previously that can be carried over to the new coding type (in this case loops).</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited (as was everyoneâ€™s) by my lack of knowledge on this new coding type. We all had to discover new features together and it made it quite hard to write the code when we didn't know some of the terminologies. A habit I need to work on is relying to much on other people which slowed my individual progress. Next time I will try to change these things. Overall though I think it was a successful lesson and I learned lots in a short amount of time.</td>
