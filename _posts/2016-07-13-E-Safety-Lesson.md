Today our class had a lesson about E safety and things to not do with electronic devices. We started out with discussing our homework in small groups, which was to read an article on sexting. We told each other what we had learned and we showed the articles to each other. The class then came together to have a full discussion with Mr Keen. We secured our knowledge of E safety and I think most of us are confident in appropriate internet behaviour. My target is to read the articles more carefully and be more interested in the work
