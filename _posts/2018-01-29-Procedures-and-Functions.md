    <td>After a talk from Mr keen on the types of code that we were looking at in today's lesson, which was functions and procedures, we began to start our work on 'worksheet 8’ which was about, as said before, functions and procedures as well as how to use them. We had to use procedures and functions to start to build a card game. We had to finish this for homework if we didn’t finish</td>

    <td>I learned well by trying to be quite involved at the beginning of the lesson when we were being talked to by Mr Keen. I asked a lot of questions that helped me understand what we were doing a bit more and likely helped others in the class. I also did a lot of independent work that helped me focus much more during my work

    <td>I talked to the people around me a bit during the lesson that may have made them not make as much progress (as well as me). I also asked some stupid questions during the beginning of the lesson that wasted a bit of time. Next week I will make sure my questions are relevant and have not already been answered before I ask them. I will also make sure I work independently when told to and do not disturb other people </td>
