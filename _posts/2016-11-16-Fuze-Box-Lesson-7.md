In IT we took a break from the Fuze box we are doing coding on and did a lesson purely devoted to our blog and how to keep them up to a good standard. We were shown a few examples of good blogs and some examples of bad blogs to give us an idea of what our blogs should be aiming to look like. I set myself the task of improving my posts and the presentation of my blog, to keep it up to the standard. We listened to lots of advice and information about our blogs from the teacher which I sometimes did not hear as i lost concentration once or twice. My target for the lesson is to not lose concentration and listen more thoroughly to take in all of the information.
