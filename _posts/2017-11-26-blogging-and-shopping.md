    <td>In today's lesson, we had a cover teacher and continued with our spreadsheets and blogs. I spent most of the lesson working on my 'virtual shop' and trying to work out discounts. For the rest of the lesson i attempted to fix the layout problems with my blog and managed to do quite well</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learned by looking back at the notes in my planner and seeing different ways of doing things on a spreadsheet. This helped me when i was using experimentation to try and make the discounts on my ‘virtual shop’. I also got help from my friends when trying to fix my blog and they helped me by showing their code. I also used the history feature to see where I broke my blog</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? What will I change for next time? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I struggled to do anything positive with my blog and I found it hard to figure out what was wrong with it. I also spoke with my friends a lot which limited both my and their learning. I also didn’t make much progress on my spreadsheets as I found it very hard to work out. I also had to fix an issue with my ‘shop’ that took up a lot of time and gave me less time to do other things. In future i will check my work before moving on and not talk to people as much</td>
