  <tr>
    <td>I learned by keeping to myself and being independent with my work. This allowed me to learn more about codecademy in the lesson and i was able to accomplish more than i usually am able to do thanks to this. I also didn't ask many questions to the teacher or my classmates which made the work more challenging but i was able to be more independant. We learned all about lists and dictionaries in python code.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to be noting more things down in the lesson to help me in the future exercises as this time i felt i had little notes to work off of and i didn't make as many as before because i was not in full understanding of the work. I also need to be more focused on what i am doing as a few times i stopped working to talk to the people next to me.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will be more focused on my own work rather than other peoples and I will make more notes so i can find exercises i complete in the future more simple and less challenging. I will also not use hints in python as much as i did this lesson</td>
