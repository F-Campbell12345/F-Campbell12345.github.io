Fuze Lesson 6
In the lesson today our class again continued to work on the fuse box basic coding book. My group easily turned on our computer and started to code quickly. We raced through the book and caught up after a few lessons with a slow start. I did briefly get sidetracked this week but I eventually went back to my work. Me and my partner worked well this week but we could have been a little more focused on our work. The pair next to us were also not exactly being helpful as sometimes they sabotaged our work.
