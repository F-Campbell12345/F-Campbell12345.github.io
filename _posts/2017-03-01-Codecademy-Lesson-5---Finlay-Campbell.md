    <td>I tried to learn by talking to my friends when i was stuck to help me understand the code more but i also helped them do their work as well by giving hints. When i was really stuck though i asked the teacher for help which made me realise my mistakes on codecademy. I also took more notes to help me in the future and challenged myself by not using the provided hints</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to become more independent in my learning so i can make it through without the help of others and i also need to use my knowledge better so i can become faster. I should also not use the hints as much so i learn more myself</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will not use the provided hints on codecademy or ask the teacher/my friends for advice to make myself a more independent learner. I will also apply my knowledge i noted down in this lesson and use it in the next. I also need to go 5% more in codecademy.</td>
