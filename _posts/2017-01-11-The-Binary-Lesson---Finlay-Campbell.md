    <td>I learned by listening to the teacher and applying my knowledge on the subject to make myself more understanding of the topic. I also took notes which let me refer back to what had already been said. This was useful as I was always able to link what had been said back to previous points. I also tried to not talk to my friends and focus on what the teacher was saying</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes I lost focus at the beginning of the lesson because I already knew what the teacher was trying to explain to everyone as I had studied it beforehand as well as a few of my classmates. Even though I had done it all before I do think I should of been paying attention because I may have needed a refresher on the subject as it had been a while since I had done work on it.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to keep my focus for the entire duration of the lesson even if I don't think I need to. I will also not talk to my friends and try to keep quiet in the lesson more. I will also try to improve the quality of my work</td>
