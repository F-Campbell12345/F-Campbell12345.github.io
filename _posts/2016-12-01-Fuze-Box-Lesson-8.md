Fuze Lesson 8

In IT today we worked on fixing our blogs and improving the quality of the posts. I made amazing progress in the lesson and managed to change my blog from a relatively boring website into an attractive on with an interesting background and font. I also managed to complete my target of not getting distracted and set myself a new one of being able to set my background to a fixed position

I have also decided to treat my blog as more of an important project than a side project, it is now my main priority for IT lessons.

I think I did very well at my independent work this lesson and I accomplished more than I normally do on my own without any help from others. I also think I did well when working with my partner as we did not stray from the task and stayed focused. My new target is to make my blog become more advanced and make the code move to a higher level (I.e making the areas for text into different shapes to make the website more interesting to look at).
