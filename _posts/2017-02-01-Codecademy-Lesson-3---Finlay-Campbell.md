    <td>I learned by sticking to the work and occasionally making notes to help me in the future of my coding. The work got tricky at times and I worked with my partners to help make the work easier. 2 heads are better than 1! I also read the instructions a few times over to secure my knowledge of the subject</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I may have talked to my friends a bit too much which limited both of our learning. I also had a very limited knowledge of coding which affected the speed and progress of my personal learning. I also got distracted a few times as I was not too interested in the subject and found some of it boring</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will not talk to my friends as much and only do so for the purposes of learning. I will also try to engage with the work more and not lose focus, to speed up my work and improve the quality. I will also use my new found knowledge to make the work easier and more enjoyable to experience and complete</td>
