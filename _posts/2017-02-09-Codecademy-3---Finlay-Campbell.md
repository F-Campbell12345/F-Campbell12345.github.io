    <td>I learned effectively by using the same methods as last lesson. I used my notes I had made to help me progress further in the course and I talked to my friends when I needed help or had to give them a few pointers and I didn't anytime else. I also like before read the instructions a few times over to let the information sink in and make sure that I understood it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing much limited my learning in the lesson. I did have to pause once and stop my work because I needed the teacher to help with the status of my blog but nothing else. I got on with the work and made good progress in the time that I had. I may need to work on my own better though as that would help me be faster at my work</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work harder on the Codecademy course and make sure I keep up the standard and speed of my work. I will also continue to cooperate with my peers in a way that does not disrupt our learning but instead helps us develop our skills of coding Python. I will also do work at home to help my understanding of the code</td>
