    <td>In our lesson today we continued our project on making our own 'Buzzfeed' quiz. We had no introduction and were sent straight to work and given the homework of finishing the quiz. I managed to get my quiz finished in the lesson and I was able to run a few test on it and figure out any bugs.</td>

    <td> I learned well by working by myself for most of the lesson, allowing me to get a lot of good quality work done without any distractions. I did cooperate with the people around me on several occasions when I was really stuck on my code. This managed to let me do a lot of work very quickly and well. It was a very successful lesson in my opinion </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? What will I change for next time? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I wrote my quiz code ‘procedurally’ which is, to be honest, the easy way of writing code. I could've challenged myself more by using loops to write my code and in future projects I will attempt to not use the easy method and will try the harder way. Also at the end of the lesson when I was testing my quiz, I got more easily distracted by people around me. In future I will try and refrain from being distracted</td>
