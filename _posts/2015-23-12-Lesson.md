**Lesson**

In today's lesson our class looked at advert stereotypes and how to deconstruct them. I think we worked well and it was a very enjoyable lesson. My favourite part was watching the advert about the fat hamsters turning into thin famous people. My target would probably be that i could have focused more on the advert meaning than the humour.
