    <td>In the past four weeks we have been using google sheets to learn how to code and decode messages. We started off easily by just learning how to decode messages with our brain and not the computer. We learned what shift cyphers were, how to solve them and most importantly how we could make our own. We then moved on to using code in the following week. We learned how to make the computer solve our code and how to use code such as the dollar sign ($) which makes the selection stay at the designated place, and not move around. We then learned about how to use 'concatenation' and other functions to make the code be auto solved for us.</td>

    <td>I learned by paying close attention to the teacher when he explained to us what we were going to be doing in the lesson. I used the notes page in my planner to note down important lines of code and their functions. This helped me to remember what I needed to use when doing the coding. Another thing that helped me to learn was cooperating with my peers. We shared ideas and helped each other on part of the code that we did not understand. I did do some independent work though and it helped me to understand how the code worked more effectively, without just relying on other people to tell me </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes when I was working in the past few weeks I got carried away with working with my friends and instead of continuing to edit my code. This impacted my learning and the learning of the other around me. In the future I will try to ’isolate’ myself from the people around me and work by myself so I can learn more and do more. My limited knowledge of coding also made it hard for me as I had to completely rely on my peers and Mr Tansley for the work. If i knew more about this kind of code I will be able to do more. For next time I may look into some other types of code and try to learn about it myself. </td>
