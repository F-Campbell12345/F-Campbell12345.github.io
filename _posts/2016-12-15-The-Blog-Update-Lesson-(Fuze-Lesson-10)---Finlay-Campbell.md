  <tr>
    <td>I learned by trying to keep my focus and not be distracted by other people and events happening around me. I used websites and tutorials to accomplish what I needed to do in the lesson after using my initiative and asking my friends for advice. I also tried to stay calm and not panic when things went wrong</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was not very good at coding and I did not use my common sense with the code as much as I probably should have. Also the person next to me is a little distracting because they are my friend and I had an urge to talk to them which limited my learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Newt time I will talk to my friend less and use more common sense in my work so what I produce is not the work of others, but my work instead. I also need to not rush my work and instead go more slowly to make my work more accurate I will also spend less time procrastinating on making the systems of my blog more advanced, as I have been putting it off for a while now.</td>
