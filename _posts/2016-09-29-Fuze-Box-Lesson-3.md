Our IT lesson started of smoothly today and me and my partner managed to set up the fuze box with minimal difficulty. We delved deeper into the coding and completed many exercises quickly. We worked well and had a good system where one of us would read the instructions and one would code. My target is to not look at other people's work so much and focus more on my own work as it did slow my pair down a bit
