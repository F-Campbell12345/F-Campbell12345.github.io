  <tr>
    <td>I learned by trying to keep focused for the whole lesson and not get sidetracked. I used help from my friends and a helpful website named W3Schools when I was stuck after making lots of attempts to solve the problems I had on my own. I also tried to not talk with other people so my focus would be completely on the work we were doing. During the work on the Fuze I did well by sharing out the work with my partner so we would work as efficiently as possible with not many hindrances.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by my general lack of knowledge on advanced coding as I am a relatively new learner of code and I sometimes struggle without help. I also struggled due to the multiple temptations I had to talk to the people around me and take my focus off of the work I was doing. I would definitely work better on my own as I normally get distracted when other people are around me.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to be faster with my coding and I will try to expand my knowledge of coding at home by doing more work than before. I will also try to be more isolated from the people around me so I won't be tempted to have a conversation with them and I will only talk to my partner during the group work.</td>
