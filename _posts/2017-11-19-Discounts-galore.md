    <td>In today's lesson we were re visiting our 'virtual shop' on google sheets and attempting to work out how to ‘discount’ items. After help from Mr Tansley through a bit of explanation, we were sent to work to try and find out how to do the work mostly by ourselves. We also had to finish last week's work if we didn’t already. I figured out how to do a ‘buy one get one half price’ deal and a ‘half price’ deal in the lesson but wasn’t able to work out the ‘buy one get one free’ deal</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by using experimentation on the sheets to try and get my method right. I tried many different combinations to attempt to get it right and I found that really helpful. I also worked with the people around me and we used our combined knowledge to solve many of the discounts on our ‘shops’. I found these ways of working to be very effective and useful and i will continue to use them in future lessons</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? What will I change for next time? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I need to make more progress in the lessons and make my work more expansive by proceeding as far as the extension tasks. I will try to do this by working more independently and focusing more. Mainly though I think that this lesson went really well and I made a lot of progress. If I continue at this standard I am sure I will be much better at spreadsheets by the end of the term</td>
