**Microbit lesson**

On the 22nd of april our class had a lesson on the bbc micro bit coding types. We used lots of different methods and tutorials and had lots of fun programming our microbits to display symbols or letters. I think i managed to learn how to do the coding well but i did struggle with one of the methods. In all i learned lots and had fun.
