Fuse Box lesson 1

Today we learned about how to set up and manage a computer called a fuze box. The computer was lacking a monitor, power source and a mouse so we had to add on all of the things from the regular computers we used in lessons before. My target for the lesson is to try more solutions before i ask the teacher for help. I think what I did well was my choice of partner as i didn't mess around with him and we managed to complete the tasks very quickly.
