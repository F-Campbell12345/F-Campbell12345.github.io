  <tr>
    <td>I learned by listening to the teacher and occasionally making a note of important information that i could forget. I also tried to stay quiet and not talk to my friends as to not prohibit both of our learning. I also learned on the codecademy website by reading the instructions a few times over and asking my friends for help if i got stuck.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of the major things that had an impact on my learning that I found made my work and subsequently my learning harder was the limited knowledge i had about python coding. Though it is very easy to pick up, i did have a hard time at first. I couldn't tell a variable from a string! I was also quite tempted to talk to my friends which made me slow down a bit.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will try to get the work done faster and advance into harder parts of the python course by applying my new knowledge and not talking to my friends as much. I will also try to listen to Mr Keen more as the thing he says may give me more help in advancing through the course on the codecademy website.</td>
