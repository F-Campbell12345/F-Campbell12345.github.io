Today in IT we had another lesson on setting up and coding on our fuze box. For my pair, the lesson did not start that well though because our computer was having a few problems but after a while we were able to start. I think me and my pair worked well as we got really far through the exercises even with a twenty minute penalty. my target is to not mess around and try to watch what the teachers are doing if my fuze box doesn't work again so I will gain a broader knowledge of the software.
