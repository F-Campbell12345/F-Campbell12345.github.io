    <td>In the lesson we took a small break from codecademy and studied a video on feminism. We all shared our ideas and learned a lot about how the rights are insulting and the phrase ".....like a girl" is used as an insult. I learned by listening to other people's points and contributing appropriate information to the discussion</td>

    <td>I was occasionally distracted in the lesson while other people we talking as i was discussing with my friend. This meant i missed some of the key information that was going around and i was a bit clueless after i rejoined the conversation. I also didn't contribute much to the lesson and if i did i would have become more involved </td>
