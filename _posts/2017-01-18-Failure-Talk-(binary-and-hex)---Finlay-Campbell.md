    <td>We were all at the front of the class and we were singled out to have our blogs inspected. We then all began to learn about how failure is Ok and we watched some videos about people who constantly failed and never gave up. We all had to listen quietly while we were told about how if you keep failing over and over again, you are never really improving and there is no real point to it. We also learned about hexadecimal which is the number system in base 16 (compared to binary in base 2, and base 10). We all learned lots and learned by listening to the teacher and occasionally taking notes on our computers or in our diaries.   </td>

    <td>I may have been limited by the lack of knowledge i had on binary and hexadecimal. I also was limited by the fact i knew all of the stuff already which did make me lose focus a couple of times and i missed some crucial points and information. I also need to not talk to others which affects their learning and mine in a negative way</td>

    <td>Next time i will be more focused on the lesson and less on my previous knowledge. I will also be faster with my computer as I fell behind one time. I will also not talk to my friends and try to keep quiet in the lesson more. I will also try to improve the quality of my work as it may have been lacking in that particular lesson</td>
