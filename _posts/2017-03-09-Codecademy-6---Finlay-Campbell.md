    <td>I learned by keeping to myself and trying to be more independent with my Codecademy work. I only asked my friends for help when I was really stuck. I also took more notes to help me in the future if I forget something. I also worked as fast as I could to maximise the amount of work I did in the lesson</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work more with myself as I used the hints on the work a bit too much. If I try to not use them then I will become more independent and will need less help. I also need to read the instructions more carefully as I lost my way a couple of times</td>

    <td>next time I will not use the hints as much to make my work more of my own and I will also do some work at home to make myself faster and better at Codecademy. I will also not ask others for help as much </td>
