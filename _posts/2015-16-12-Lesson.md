**Lesson**

on the 16th of december our class 7T had a lesson all about media. it was very interesting and we had lots of fun playing 'bingo' together. my target is to if we ever do a ‘bingo’ thing again, to do it better by doing less "chatting" to my friends. we all worked well together and we had fun.
