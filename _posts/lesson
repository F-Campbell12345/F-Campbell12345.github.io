**LESSON**

On the 27th of September in our it lesson we learned how to make our own blog/website. 
It was really fun and i think the class worked really well in the lesson. 
My personal target was to maybe listen a bit more closely because a couple of times i stopped listening and missed some info.
I think what went well was that i got the hang of the software quite quickly and eventually found it quite easy to use.
