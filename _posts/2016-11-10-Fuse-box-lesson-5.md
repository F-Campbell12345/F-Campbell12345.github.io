Last lesson in IT our class continued working on the fuse boxes. Me and my partner had a hard time setting up our fuse box as once again the cable had a problem. After a long wait our computer managed to switch and we worked hard in what 

little time we had. I think me and my pair worked very efficiently and made up for the fact our cable was not working. My target is to try more ways of fixing the computer if it doesn't work.
