    <td>In our lesson today we learned about a method called run length encoding from a new teacher. Run length encoding is a method of compressing files and is fairly simple. We started out by learning about the method and how it works, then trying it out ourselves by making our own image and compressing it into code. The method is that if you have 4 bytes that are coloured red and then three that are blue, the code could be compressed into 4r and 3b. Afterwards we then had to rebuild another person image to make sure that their code was correct. The lesson was very enjoyable and I learned a lot</td>

    <td>I learned well by working alone as I was able to quickly finish my image and compressing it down. I did confer once or twice with my partner over the method but it helped us both and was a good way for us to learn. I also listened well to the teacher and took my time on my work to make sure it was good quality. I also listened to the teachers instructions and was quiet when I was told to be. Overall I think it was a good lesson</td>

    <td>When I had finished my work I found out that it was incorrect and may have wasted some of the teachers time asking what i did wrong. Also when i had finished my work, I was given a small extension task and I was less focused and it took me a longer time than it should have as I was talking with other people who had finished which limited both mine, and their learning. Next time I will fix all of these things to make sure that I learn better</td>
