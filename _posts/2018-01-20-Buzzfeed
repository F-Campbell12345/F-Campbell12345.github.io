    <td>In our lesson today we opened in a strange fashion, by taking a Buzzfeed quiz of our choice on their website. This was an opening to a new project we will be starting which is creating our own quiz on python. We had to write our own set of questions after learning about all of the different types of logic that can be used and we had to plan how we would use our own logic for our quiz.</td>

    <td>I learned well by working independently from other people and focusing on my own work for the majority of the time we had in the lesson. I did cooperate with the person next to me for some parts of the lesson (specifically when we were working on our questions) as we were able to give each other ideas on what to use and how the logic would work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? What will I change for next time? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When we were taking the quizzes I think I may have talked a bit too much with the people around me and that slowed down not only me but them as well. I also may have taken a bit too long on writing my questions and logic as I had to finish them for homework. Next time I will resolve all of these issues but will mostly try and make the next lesson similar to this one as it was mostly a successful lesson</td>
