**Lesson **

On the 26th of February our class had an AMAZING lesson on our identity maps. We all came in and were told to sit in register order and get out our maps. We were then instructed to go around the room commenting on each others maps on an A4 sheet. It was tons of fun and i learned something new about all of my classmates. Once it was over i looked at my comment sheet and was very happy with what was written on them . During the lesson there was a funny moment when Mr Keen messed up his marking and told me to call him a "stupid muppet", i was so scared to answer in case it was a trick to get me in trouble that i spoke in a quiet and squeaky voice. We all had a good laugh afterwards. My target would be to focus more on commenting than reading the posters
