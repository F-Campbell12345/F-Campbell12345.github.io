Today in IT we started to create our microbit game and learned to do flowcharts to plan out our game. We also made a google doc with some of the main concepts of our games on it. My game idea is about making a character go into a hole in a wall. I learned today how to make a flowchart and which order the boxes go in and i also learned a new technique for movement on microbit. My target is to do less talking and more work.
