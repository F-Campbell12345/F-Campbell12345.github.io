  <tr>
    <td>In today's lesson we learned how to perform functions in a spreadsheet in the form of a virtual 'shop’. With the help of Mr Tansley we managed to use skills we had learned to create and example ‘shop’ on the board and we then returned to our computers and attempted to create one for ourselves. We used functions such as making cells display numbers in the form of a currency and how to create a dropdown on cells to choose between different pieces of data</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My main way of taking in the information was to note down a few words and bits of function in my planner in the notes section. This allowed me to remember more and not make many mistakes. I also worked with the people around me which helped as when i couldn't remeber something, it was likely one of my peers did. I also provided them with information i remembered, helping all of us improve our work</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? What will I change for next time? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes when I was working with my friends, like last week, i got a bit distracted and started to talk to my friends about things unrelated to the work that we were doing on our spreadsheets. This limited my learning and may have limited the learning of others around me and I will refrain from doing his in the future. I had some trouble turning on my computer at the beginning of the lesson and i lost about 5 minutes of work time trying to turn it on. In the future I will try to get help if I face this problem again, so I don't lose as much work time </td>
