On the 27th of september in our it lesson we learned how to make our own blog/website. It was really fun and i think the class worked really well in the lesson. My personal target was to maybe listen a bit more closely because a couple of times i stopped listening and missed some info. I think what went well was that i got the hang of the software quite quickly and eventually found it quite easy to use.
