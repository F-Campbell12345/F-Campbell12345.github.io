Today in IT our class took a break from the Fuze box project to work on fixing our blog posts. I went over my previous posts and corrected grammar, punctuation and sentences that did not make any sense. I think i did pretty well in the lesson and I fulfilled my target to work on my own and not get distracted. My target for next lesson is not panic if something goes wrong and stay calm
