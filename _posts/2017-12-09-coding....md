    <td>In today's lesson we used 'repl,it' to learn about python coding again. Today we looked at lists and the functions that we can use on them, such as the .append function. We worked on several worksheets given to us by Mr Keen and went through tasks where we had to do different types of coding involving lists</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learned by listening closely to the teacher and trying to remember exactly what he was saying and finish the work quickly. This worked well and I managed to be able to help the person next to me with his work when I was done. I also learned by co-operating with the person next to me as we managed to get a lot done with both of our views and ideas of how to do the work</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? What will I change for next time? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I did get distracted a couple of times when the teacher was explaining things to us which made me have to rely on my peers for the information I wasn’t paying attention to. I also need to put up my hand more as I didn’t put my hand up in the lesson even though I understood what we were talking about. I also need to be more independent in my work as it will give me good habits for the future
