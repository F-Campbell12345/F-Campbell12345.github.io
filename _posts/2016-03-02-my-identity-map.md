**my identity map**

over the half term our class had to make an identity map about our family, social media usage and life goals. It was very fun to make the map and i was excited to share it with my classmates, i was thinking it would help them learn something new about me. In the lesson we had to comment on each others maps and i really enjoyed it. It really helped me learn more about my classmates. even though i got some negative comments on my sheet i was still happy with my classes opinion and grade of my map. This process is different to commenting online as the person is in the room and could be watching you from the other side of the room or just a few chairs down. Based on the lessons we have been having recently i have told myself to change my social media usage by **NEVER** posting a picture where I can be seen (for my safety). My view on social media has been changed from me thinking it is just a fun thing to share with my mates, to something scary that i have to be really careful with. The lessons have changed how i will use it in the future by making me not ever want to use twitter ever as it seems to be a dangerous place.
