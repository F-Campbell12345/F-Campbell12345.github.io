Today we had a lesson reviewing our prezi work from over the easter holidays. We looked at some people's presentations including a very easy to criticise prezi from a different class which in my opinion was laughably bad. Overall the lesson was very fun and i enjoyed it. My target is to fix stupid errors in my blog similar to the ones in the bad prezi.
