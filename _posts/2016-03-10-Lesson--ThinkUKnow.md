**Lesson- ThinkUKnow**

Our class have had a lesson on internet safety and correct usage of media like youtube. It was very enjoyable and most of the lesson was devoted to watching a video about it called "first to 1 million". It was good and i really enjoyed the aspect of multiple choice that Mr Keen gave to us. It was particularly funny when half the class chose to break the law in one of the choices. My target was to have my thoughts less influenced by what the people around me did.
